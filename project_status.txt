Next Major Feature: Multi-User Room System
----------------------------------------

Overview:
The application will be transformed into a Kahoot-style room-based system where one user (host) can create a session and multiple users (guests) can join to receive real-time translations of the host's speech.

Key Components:

1. Room Management:
   - Generate unique 5-letter room codes (e.g., "AXBCD")
   - Room creation interface for hosts
   - Room joining interface for guests
   - Real-time room status tracking
   - Maximum participants per room limit

2. User Types:
   a) Host:
      - Creates and manages the room
      - Controls session start/stop
      - Broadcasts audio for transcription
      - Can see number of connected guests
      - Can end session for all participants
   
   b) Guests:
      - Join using 5-letter room code
      - Select preferred translation language
      - View real-time transcripts and translations
      - See host's speaking status
      - Can leave session independently

3. UI Requirements:
   - Landing page with host/guest selection
   - Room creation page for hosts
   - Room joining page for guests
   - Language selection interface for guests
   - Participant counter display
   - Session status indicators
   - Kahoot-style color scheme and design
   - Mobile-responsive layouts

4. Backend Requirements:
   - Room state management system
   - WebSocket rooms/channels implementation
   - Room code generation and validation
   - Session cleanup on host disconnection
   - Concurrent translation streams management
   - Language preference tracking per user

Technical Requirements:
----------------------
- Existing:
  - AssemblyAI API key
  - OpenAI API key
  - Python 3.8+
  - Modern web browser with AudioWorklet support

- Additional:
  - Redis/similar for room state management
  - Enhanced WebSocket implementation for rooms
  - Session management system
  - Rate limiting for room creation

Current Dependencies:
-------------------
- FastAPI
- uvicorn
- python-multipart
- jinja2
- python-dotenv
- assemblyai
- langchain-openai
- langchain-core

Additional Dependencies Needed:
----------------------------
- Redis (for room management)
- FastAPI WebSocket rooms extension
- Rate limiting middleware
- Session management library

Next Implementation Steps:
------------------------
1. Room System Backend:
   - Implement room code generation
   - Create room state management
   - Setup WebSocket rooms
   - Add session tracking

2. User Interface:
   - Create landing page
   - Design room creation flow
   - Build room joining interface
   - Add language selection component
   - Implement participant display

3. WebSocket Enhancement:
   - Add room-based message routing
   - Implement host/guest role management
   - Add broadcast capabilities
   - Handle disconnections gracefully

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Room creation/joining flow
   - Multiple concurrent rooms
   - Different language translations
   - Connection recovery
   - Session cleanup
   - Load testing with multiple users

Known Limitations to Address:
---------------------------
- Need to implement room expiration
- Handle host disconnection gracefully
- Manage translation API rate limits
- Consider room size limits
- Plan for scaling considerations

Security Considerations:
----------------------
- Room code uniqueness and security
- Rate limiting for room creation/joining
- Input validation for room codes
- WebSocket connection authentication
- User role verification
- API key protection

Future Enhancements:
-------------------
- Host authentication system
- Persistent room history
- Custom room settings
- Multiple hosts per room
- Recording capabilities
- Chat functionality between participants
- Custom branding options
- Room templates
- Waiting room functionality
- Room moderation tools
