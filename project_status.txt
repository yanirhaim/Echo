Next Major Feature: Per-Guest Language Selection
----------------------------------------

Overview:
Implement a system where each guest can select their preferred language for translation, allowing multiple users to receive translations in different languages simultaneously.

Key Components:

1. Language Selection UI:
   - Language selection dropdown for guests
   - Supported languages list
   - Save language preference
   - Visual indicator of current language
   - Ability to change language during session

2. Backend Requirements:
   - Store language preferences per user
   - Handle multiple simultaneous translations
   - Optimize translation requests
   - Cache common translations
   - Handle translation failures gracefully

3. Translation System Updates:
   - Modify translation pipeline for multiple languages
   - Implement efficient batching of translations
   - Add translation queue management
   - Track translation status per user
   - Handle rate limiting for multiple translations

4. WebSocket Enhancement:
   - Update message format for language-specific translations
   - Target translations to specific users
   - Handle language change events
   - Maintain translation state per user

Technical Requirements:
----------------------
Current:
  - AssemblyAI API key
  - OpenAI API key
  - Python 3.8+
  - Modern web browser with AudioWorklet support
  - FastAPI
  - WebSocket support
  - Room management system

Additional Needed:
  - Translation caching system
  - Enhanced message routing
  - Rate limiting for translations
  - Language validation system

Implementation Steps:
-------------------
1. Frontend Updates:
   - Add language selection UI component
   - Implement language change handlers
   - Update translation display system
   - Add language preference storage

2. Backend Updates:
   - Modify translation service for multiple languages
   - Add user language preference storage
   - Implement translation caching
   - Update WebSocket message handling

3. Translation System:
   - Implement efficient translation queuing
   - Add batch translation processing
   - Optimize API usage
   - Add translation status tracking

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Multiple users with different languages
   - Language switching during session
   - Translation performance under load
   - Cache effectiveness
   - Error handling

Future Enhancements:
-------------------
- Translation memory for repeated phrases
- Automatic language detection
- Custom translation dictionaries
- Translation quality feedback
- Fallback language options
- Translation conflict resolution
- Language-specific formatting
- Regional language variants
- Translation performance analytics

Security Considerations:
----------------------
- Validate language selections
- Rate limit language changes
- Protect against API abuse
- Ensure proper message routing
- Validate translation requests

Known Limitations to Address:
---------------------------
- Translation API rate limits
- Language support limitations
- Translation latency
- Resource usage for multiple translations
- Cache size management
