Echo Project Status Report
-------------------------

Working Features:
✅ Real-time audio capture from browser
✅ WebSocket connection established successfully
✅ Audio streaming to AssemblyAI
✅ Real-time transcription display
✅ Clean and responsive UI
✅ Start/Stop functionality
✅ Connection status indicators
✅ Proper audio processing with AudioWorklet
✅ Translation displaying correctly
✅ Translation API pipeline functioning

Issues to Resolve:
❌ Transcript history not maintained (transcripts disappear after translation)
   Potential causes:
   - Current implementation overwrites previous content
   - Need to implement paragraph-based display system
   - Need to modify frontend to support multiple transcript entries

Next Steps:
1. Implement transcript history:
   - Modify frontend to append new transcripts instead of replacing
   - Add timestamps for each transcript segment
   - Maintain parallel translation history
   - Consider adding a clear history button

2. Potential Future Improvements:
   - Add language selection dropdown
   - Add error handling for API failures
   - Implement retry mechanism for failed API calls
   - Add loading indicators during translation
   - Add audio input device selection

Technical Requirements:
- AssemblyAI API key
- OpenAI API key
- Python 3.8+
- Modern web browser with AudioWorklet support

Current Dependencies:
- FastAPI
- uvicorn
- python-multipart
- jinja2
- python-dotenv
- assemblyai
- langchain-openai
- langchain-core

Environment Setup:
- .env file must include both ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
- Virtual environment recommended
- CORS and security headers configured for AudioWorklet

Testing Needed:
- Transcript history implementation
- Translation history synchronization
- Cross-browser compatibility check
