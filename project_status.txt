Echo Project Status Report
-------------------------

Working Features:
✅ Real-time audio capture from browser
✅ WebSocket connection established successfully
✅ Audio streaming to AssemblyAI
✅ Real-time transcription display
✅ Clean and responsive UI
✅ Start/Stop functionality
✅ Connection status indicators
✅ Proper audio processing with AudioWorklet

Issues to Resolve:
❌ Translation not displaying (while transcription works)
   Potential causes:
   - Translation API call might not be completing
   - Translation results might not be reaching the frontend
   - Need to check if translate() function in text_translation.py is being called
   - Verify OpenAI API key and permissions

Next Steps:
1. Debug translation pipeline:
   - Add logging in text_translation.py to verify API calls
   - Check WebSocket messages for translation events
   - Verify OpenAI API rate limits and quotas

2. Potential Improvements:
   - Add language selection dropdown
   - Add error handling for API failures
   - Implement retry mechanism for failed API calls
   - Add loading indicators during translation
   - Consider adding transcript history
   - Add audio input device selection

Technical Requirements:
- AssemblyAI API key
- OpenAI API key
- Python 3.8+
- Modern web browser with AudioWorklet support

Current Dependencies:
- FastAPI
- uvicorn
- python-multipart
- jinja2
- python-dotenv
- assemblyai
- langchain-openai
- langchain-core

Environment Setup:
- .env file must include both ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
- Virtual environment recommended
- CORS and security headers configured for AudioWorklet

Testing Needed:
- Translation pipeline end-to-end testing
- Error handling verification
- Cross-browser compatibility check
